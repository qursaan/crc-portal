Purpose
===
A federation is defined as a union comprising a number of partially self-governing regions united by a central government under a common set of objectives. 
The purpose of federation is to establish the interconnection between two or more independent testbeds for creating a richer testing environment, which increase the experimentation multilateral benefits rather than the users of the individual testbeds. The portal allows researchers to access through out different testbed. Therefore, the testbeds becomes more dynamic and evolve over time based on the requirements of the users. Furthermore, the federation portal supports user interface of testbeds control and management. In this paper, we will review the current federation framework from portal view; design a prototype for CRC federation architecture. The goal of federation portal is to simplify the large-scale of testbed web access and management over different infrastructure and organization.

#Federation Components
We divide the federation system to four sub-systems as the following:
* Site Management
    - Site configuration.
    - Site registration.
    - Sites controls.
* Authentication Management: to management key authentication between sites.
* Policy Management:to Manage policy for resources.
* Resources Management
    - Add resources.
    - setting sharing policy.
    - control resources.
